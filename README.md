# Python-Trading-Bot
### Explanation of the Code
* DataFrame Setup:

A sample DataFrame is created with columns position (e.g., 1 for a buy signal, 0 for no action) and Close (representing the closing price).
Initial Balance:

The balance variable represents your trading budget. Adjust it based on your requirements.
Logic for Buying and Selling:

If row['position'] == 1 (indicating a buy signal) and balance >= row['Close'], the bot "buys," reducing the balance.
If row['position'] == 0, it skips buying (you can add sell logic here if needed).
Iterate Over Rows:

The loop uses iterrows() to process each row, ensuring proper scalar access to row['position'] and row['Close'].
Output:

Prints the results of each action (buying or skipping), along with the remaining balance after each operation.
